# Summation

The above summation is equivalent to the below for-loop in Java:

```java
int a = 0;
for (int j = 1; j <= 3; j++){
    a = a + xj
}
```

Empty sums are zero:

Order of expansion does not matter:
$$
Associativity \\a+(b+c)=(a+b)+c
$$

$$
Commutativity \\a+b=b+a
$$



# Product

Think about it as a for-loop with multiplication inside instead of summation

Empty products are 1:
