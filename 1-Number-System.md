# Number System

<img src="images\relations.PNG" height="40" />

<img src="images\N.JPG" height="25" /> **Natural Numbers**	| 0, 1, 2, 3,...

<img src="images\Z.JPG" height="25" /> **Integers**	| -2, -1, 0, 1, 2,...

<img src="images\Q.JPG" height="25" /> **Rational Numbers**	| 4/8, -4/6, 2/3

<img src="images\R.JPG" height="25" /> **Real Numbers** | sqrt(2), pi(3.14159), e(2.17182)

<img src="images\C.JPG" height="25" /> **Complex Numbers** | 6+4i



# Natural Numbers

<img src="images\N.JPG" height="25" />= {1, 2, 3,...}

* Addition or multiplication of two natural numbers results in another natural number
* Subtraction or division of two natural numbers does not always result in another natural number

<img src="images\N.JPG" height="25" />can be generated with a successor relation. Any natural number can be obtained from 1 by applying the *successor relation* [S(n) = n+1]



# Integers

<img src="images\Z.JPG" height="25" /> = {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2...}

* Addition, multiplication and subtraction of two integers results in another integer
* Division of two integers does not always result in another integer

<img src="images\Z.JPG" height="25" /> can be generated with both successors and predecessors



# Rational Numbers

<img src="images\Q.JPG" height="25" /> = all numbers that can be written in the form a/b, where a and b are integers

* Closed under division 
* Has an ordering (less than or greater than relation) but no successor relation



# Real Numbers

<img src="images/R.JPG" height="25"> can be thought of those numbers consisting of unending decimal places (512.5257623.....)

* Real numbers are sometimes called *irrational numbers*



# Complex Numbers

* Squares of real numbers are positive. There is no solution to x^2^ = -1.
* Introduce *imaginary number i* with:

$$
i^2 = -1 \Longleftrightarrow i =\sqrt-1
$$

* Every complex number can be written as:

* Complex plane:

* Remember we can substitute i^2^ to -1 and -i^2^ to 1
